## Volunteers for the conference

If you want to help out during the conference, we currently need people to help
relaying questions to our lovely presenters. This requires you to be available
during one (or more) of the talks, have a working camera, microphone and join a
Jitsi session with the presenter.

You can join the IRC channel #archlinux-conf on Freenode, or send an email to
archconf@archlinux.org as we are planning a meeting through the week if you are
interested!


Cheers from the conference team!
